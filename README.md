If elderly peoples falls then it will put severe effect on their health and technology is helping humans in every aspect of their life and in this paper author is using machine learning algorithm to predict FALL scenarios by analysing their movements. In propose paper author has used SVM and Decision Tree algorithms to train SISFALL dataset and this trained model can be used to predict fall scenarios from new test data.
